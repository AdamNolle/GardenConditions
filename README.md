This couldn't be done on such a short time window for Pickhacks 2023 without using the great work of previously existing Github projects. I explain their use below but I will credit the users here as well to make sure there is no missed recognition.

## Interactive Map Of The US

Using code from the [Github repo](https://github.com/WebsiteBeaver/interactive-and-responsive-svg-map-of-us-states-capitals) we change the data attributes to suit our needs better for this project. But the funtionailty of the app goes almost soley to [dmarcs](https://github.com/WebsiteBeaver/interactive-and-responsive-svg-map-of-us-states-capitals/commits?author=dmarcs)

## New Map Credits - Map Stuff Folder

## Old Folder

### Original Map Credits

For the map here we used Leadletjs to create the map. To display the map on screen we are using the Number 5 example from this [Github repository](https://github.com/tomickigrzegorz/leaflet-examples/tree/master/docs). All old map implementation code and implementation goes to Github user [tomickigrzegorz](https://github.com/tomickigrzegorz)

# TO-DO: (in order of importance)

- [ ] Update map from [Georgy Potapov](https://github.com/Godnik)[Github repository](https://github.com/owm-inc/VANE-intro) to suit us better
- [ ] Broken Nav Bar links
